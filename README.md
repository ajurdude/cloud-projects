# Cloud Computing Projects by Arjun Jadhav

This README provides an overview of my cloud computing projects and expertise.

## Introduction

This repository contains various cloud computing projects that I have worked on, utilizing my skills in AWS, Azure, and other cloud technologies. These projects demonstrate practical solutions involving cloud infrastructure, automation, and hybrid cloud integration, emphasizing real-world impact and technical efficiency.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Secure Deployment of CharityConnect Web Application
- **Description**: Developed a cloud-based platform for charities using Jenkins for CI/CD, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and AWS (EC2, S3).
- **Security**: Integrated OWASP Sonarqube to ensure security best practices were followed throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Features**: Implemented functionalities such as user registration, catalog browsing, shopping cart, and order management, with automated deployment pipelines using Jenkins and Terraform.

### 2. Development of E-Commerce Marketplace: FabricConnect
- **Description**: Created an e-commerce platform linking designers with local suppliers using AWS services like Cloud9, EC2, S3, Lambda, and CloudWatch.
- **Objective**: Aimed to reduce global supply chain reliance and lower carbon emissions by providing a platform for local suppliers and designers in Ireland to connect easily.
- **Technical Stack**: Utilized AWS Cloud9 for development, Django for the backend, and AWS S3 for media storage. Integrated AWS SNS and SQS for notifications and messaging. Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and managed continuous deployment through AWS CodePipeline.
- **Functionality**: The platform enables designers to browse raw material catalogs, manage shopping carts, and make purchases. Suppliers can list products with images and details, while AWS SNS provides email notifications for new releases.
- **Architecture**: Leveraged Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) structure for efficient development and AWS services for scalable infrastructure. The application follows cloud-native best practices to ensure reliability and sustainability.
